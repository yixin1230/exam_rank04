Expected files   : binary_insert.c
Allowed functions: malloc

Implement a function that insets a new node with a givenvalue into 
a binary search tree.

The function should be declared as follows:
t_btree* insert_binary_tree(t_btree *root, int value);

You have to use the ft_btree.h file which will ONLY contain:
typedef struct s_btree
{
    struct s_btree  *left;
    struct s_btree  *right;
    int             *val;
    
}               t_btree;

If the root node is NULL return the new node as root.
Values already in the tree should be ignored.
Values bigger than the root should be insert in the right subtree.
Values smaller than the root should be insert in the left subtree.
Values will always be inserted at the End of a brach.
